# SkywarsTracker
SkyWars stats overlay. Tracks your stats in real time (every 15s stats are updated)

## Installation
Grab the latest jar from the releases, put it in a folder with the font (Minecraft.ttf) and start it with <code>java -jar \<file\>.jar \<apiKey\> \<uuid\></code>

I'd recommend saving the command in a bat file for faster usage.
